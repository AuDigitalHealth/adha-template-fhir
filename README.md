# adha-template-fhir
The purpose of this repository is to contain FHIR implementation guide template styling that adds FHIR specification branding (like logo), or other FHIR artefact styling.

It will directly inherit from the ADHA template `adha-template-base` (https://github.com/AuDigitalHealth/adha-template-base) and is intended to serve as a base for most Agency FHIR-style implementation guide publications.
